                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your order is an offer to cometake to buy the product(s) in your order. When you
                        place an order to purchase a product from cometake, we will send you an e-mail
                        confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the Order
                        Confirmation E-mail). The Order Confirmation E-mail is acknowledgement that we
                        have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the
                        product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for
                        a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e-mail
                        confirmation to you that we've dispatched the product to you (the Dispatch
                        Confirmation E-mail). If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you
                        may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation E-mail for each package, and each
                        Dispatch Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separatecontract of sale between us for the product(s) specified in that Dispatch Confirmation
                        E-mail. Your contract is with Cometake. Without affecting your right of cancellation
                        set out in section 2 below, you can cancel your order for a product at no cost any
                        time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that product. This
                        right to cancel does not apply to certain categories of products and services,
                        including digital products or software which are not supplied in a physical format
                        (e.g. on a CD or DVD), once download or use (whichever is earlier) has begun.

                        All products from the Cometake sites can be returned within 30 days of receipt of
                        the products to Cometake if the products are complete and are in an unused and
                        undamaged condition. For shrink-wrapped and/or sealed data media (for example
                        CDs, audio cassettes, VHS videos, DVDs, PC and video games and software) thismeans that we only take back the products in the unopened shrink wrap film or with
                        an undamaged seal. The products are to be returned via our return support centre.
                        This voluntary returns guarantee does not apply to digital products or software which
                        are not supplied on a tangible medium (e.g. on a CD or DVD). <br />

                        to you the purchase price already paid by you, but not the delivery costs of your
                        initial purchase. Likewise the transport risk and return costs might be borne by you.
