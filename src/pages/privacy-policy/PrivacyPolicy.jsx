                <p>
                    Cometake allows third party sellers to list and sell their products at Cometake.ng. In
                    each such case this is indicated on the respective product detail page. WhileCometake as a service provider helps facilitate transactions that are carried out on
                    the Cometake website, Cometake is neither the buyer nor the seller of the seller's
                    items. Cometake provides a service for sellers and buyers to negotiate and complete
                    transactions. Accordingly, the contract formed at the completion of a sale for these
                    third party products is solely between buyer and seller. Cometake is not a party to
                    this contract nor assumes any responsibility arising out of or in connection with it
                    nor is it the seller's agent. The seller is responsible for the sale of the products and
                    for dealing with any buyer claims or any other issue arising out of or in connection
                    with the contract between the buyer and seller. Because Cometake wants the buyer
                    to have a safer buying experience.

                <p>
                    These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
                    Lagos, and the application of the Nigeria Convention of Contracts for the
                    International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. If you are a consumer and have
                    your habitual residence in the UK, you additionally enjoy the protection afforded to
                    you by mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence. We both agree
                    to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the district of Lagos City,
                    which means that you may bring a claim to enforce your consumer protection rights
                    in connection with these Conditions of Use in Lagos or in the Nigeria country in
                    which you live.

                    restricted or prohibited by law. For example, economic sanctions and embargoes
                    imposed by the European Union, the United Nations, US Departments of State,
                    Treasury or Commerce, and other government authorities (such as embargoes
                    imposed on specific countries, or economic sanctions imposed on individuals or
                    companies for terrorism or money laundering offences) may prohibit you from
                    taking products to other countries, even for your own personal use, and/or sending
                    products (whether physically by mail or digitally via email or file-sharing) to
                    particular individuals, corporations, organizations or entities. In addition, you agree

                    If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed and you are
                    eligible for Brand Registry, please sign up to that service and submit your complaint
                    via Brand Registry. Otherwise, please submit your complaint using our online form
                    may be used to report all types of intellectual property claims including, but not
                    limited to, copyright, trademark, design and patent claims

                <p className='mt-5'>
                    Upon receipt of a complaint we may take certain actions, including removing
                    information or an item, and termination of repeat infringers in appropriate
                    circumstances. All such actions are taken without any admission as to liability and
                    without prejudice to any rights, remedies or defenses, all of which are expressly
                    reserved. This includes forwarding the complaint to the parties involved in the
                    provision of the allegedly infringing content. You agree to indemnify Cometake for
                    all claims brought by a third party against Cometake arising out of or in connection
                    with the submission of a complaint.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Because millions of products are listed and many thousands of customer reviews and
                    comments are hosted on cometake.net, it is not possible for us to be aware of the
                    contents of each product listed for sale, or each customer review or comment that is
                    displayed. Accordingly, we operate on a "notice and action" basis. If you believe
                    that any content on, or within a product advertised for sale on, the cometake.ng
                    website contains a defamatory statement, please notify cometake immediately by
                    completing and submitting a notice to cometke.ng. Follow the instructions in the
                    notice and send it to our email: <a href="mailto:cometake57@gmail.com" className='underline font-[600] text-primary-color'>cometake57@gmail.com</a>
