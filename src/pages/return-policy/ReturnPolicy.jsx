                        can create a return request. You will be charged if an item that is expected to
                        be returned is not sent back to us.

                        5. If the item has already been sent back to us and you have received an email
                        asking you return it or have been charged for item, we will reverse the charge
                        as soon as the return is processed by us. It might take additional time for your
                        financial institution to make funds available in your account.

                        government-issued photo identification, to consider processing a return or
                        providing a refund or replacement. All personal information you provide will
